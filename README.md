Summary of your project:What are you doing? 

We are creating a web app that provides users reviews and ratings on newand used automobiles. “Kelly Blue Book” style car review blog.

How will you do it?

The user will create an account and then the user will search the vehicle they want to leave areview on or search a vehicle they are interested in purchasing to get more information aboutit. The user will be able to rate the vehicle, comment and post a review. The user will be able toaccess a link to find the vehicle nearby.

Justification​: 

We intend to use Bootstrap for the front end design of the website. This  project is worthy of your group’s efforts because in the real world we will be working on teams as junior developers and getting lots of experience and practice with GitHub or similar repositories will help us get acclimated to sharing code virtually, help us get comfortable with SCRUM and Kanban to become better project managers. We will be using GitHub as our repository andAmazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud hosting.
